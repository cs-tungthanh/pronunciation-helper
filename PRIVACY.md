# Privacy Policy for Sayly

**Last Updated: October 25, 2026**

## Overview

Sayly is a Chrome extension that helps users learn English pronunciation. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

## How the Extension Works

The extension runs in your browser and only contacts the services listed under Third-Party Services:

1. **Text Selection**: When you select text on a webpage, the extension processes it locally in your browser
2. **IPA Notation**: Pronunciations come from a dictionary built into the extension, so looking up a word normally sends nothing. Only for a word that dictionary doesn't have, the word is sent to the Free Dictionary API (dictionaryapi.dev) - no user information is sent
3. **Translation** (optional): Translation is on by default (Vietnamese). The selected text is sent to Google Translate, or to MyMemory if Google fails, to translate it. Turn translation off in Settings to stop this
4. **Text-to-Speech**: When you press play, the text being spoken is sent to Google Translate's text-to-speech service to get the audio. If that fails, your browser's built-in speech synthesis is used instead, which runs locally
5. **No Tracking**: We don't track your usage, selections, or browsing activity
6. **No Analytics**: We don't use any analytics services
7. **No Cookies**: We don't set or read any cookies

## Permissions Used

The extension requires certain permissions to function:

- **activeTab**: To detect text selection on the current webpage
- **scripting**: To inject the pronunciation popup interface
- **offscreen**: To play pronunciation audio in a hidden extension page, so websites can't block it
- **Host permissions**: To work on any website you visit, to reach translate.googleapis.com and api.mymemory.translated.net for translation, and translate.google.com for pronunciation audio

These permissions are used solely to provide the pronunciation functionality and are not used to collect any data.

## Third-Party Services

The extension makes requests to:
- **Free Dictionary API** (dictionaryapi.dev): To fetch IPA phonetic notation for words missing from the built-in dictionary
  - Only the word itself is sent
  - No user information or identifiers are included
  - This is a public API that doesn't require authentication
- **Google Translate** (translate.googleapis.com): To translate selected text, only when translation is on
  - Only the selected text and target language are sent, without cookies
- **MyMemory** (api.mymemory.translated.net): Fallback translation when Google fails, only when translation is on
  - Only the selected text and target language are sent, without cookies
- **Google Translate text-to-speech** (translate.google.com): To play pronunciation audio, only when you press play
  - Only the text being spoken is sent

## Data Storage

- **Local Settings Only**: The extension stores your settings (disabled sites, translation language) in your browser's extension storage
- **No Cloud Storage**: We don't have any servers or cloud storage
- **No Caching**: Previous lookups are not saved or cached

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above.
